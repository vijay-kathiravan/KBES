    "You need to make sure that your witnesses participate at the right time, day and videoconference. If you are worried that a witness might not show up, you can complete a Request for Summons.

For more information, see the Practice Direction on Representation before the LTB.\n",

    "Support Persons: A support person, such as a family member or friend, can attend a hearing or mediation with you. A support person is not considered a representative as long as they don’t speak for you in the hearing or mediation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Litigation Guardians: Sometimes an application will involve a party without “legal capacity” either because the person does not have the mental capacity to make decisions about the issues in the case or, in certain cases, because the person is under 18.
